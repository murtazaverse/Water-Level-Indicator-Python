# Water-Level-Indicator-Python
A python based project designed on Raspberry-Pi that would take the readings of water level in a tank using Ultra-Sonic Sensor, displays the water level, plots the graph and performs auto correlation of the graph.

## Write.py
This file would take the values of Ultra sonic sensor and stores them in a text file

## Read.py
This file would read the values from text file and prints them, plots the graph and performs autocorrelation on it.
